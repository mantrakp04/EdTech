# Project Overview: Empowering Education through AI and Open Source

## Project Principle
*Please take a look at the credits later on, especially the video to understand the problem statement.*

### 1. Exclusively Open Source
We are committed to using 100% open source software (OSS) to ensure maximum accessibility and democratic access. This approach promotes collaboration and innovation, allowing anyone, anywhere, to contribute and benefit.

### 2. Exclusively Local Hardware
Our technology will operate solely on local servers, desktops, laptops, smart home, and portable devices, avoiding reliance on cloud or SaaS providers. This ensures our solutions are accessible in areas with limited internet connectivity.

### 3. Be Scrappy
We encourage experimentation, risk-taking, and proactive problem-solving. As a volunteer group, we believe in acting on initiative, learning from trial and error, and collaboratively deciding what integrates into our main framework.

### 4. Avoid Vendor Lock-in
While remaining model-agnostic, we prioritize avoiding dependency on any single vendor, especially major ones like OpenAI. We aim for a diverse technological ecosystem incorporating multiple providers and models, with a strong preference for open-source solutions.

### 5. Task-Constrained Approach
Recognizing our framework's constraints, we focus on identifying and designing for specific tasks. Our milestones and capabilities are measured by task completion, ensuring an empirical and objective-oriented development process.

### 6. Avoiding Overcomplication
We emphasize modest milestones and feasibility to prevent overcomplication. Our journey towards autonomous software is marked by incremental steps, always with an eye on the larger vision.

### 7. Establish New Principles
As we navigate new domains of software architecture and design, we're poised to develop and adopt novel principles, understanding that some traditional paradigms may no longer apply.

## Project Focus: Empowering Global Education through AI and Open Source Technology
